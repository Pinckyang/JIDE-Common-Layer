Build
----------

I'm using my own custom build scripts on the develop branch. So... merge changes in develop to master for the src/ directory. Then do the JIDE Common standard build: 

You can use your favorite Java IDE to build this project. By default, we provided ant script (build.xml) to build the project. You can download ant from http://ant.apache.org/. Once you install it, you can run 

"ant" or "ant dist"

to build the whole source code and produce the jar file you need for your application. 

All available targets in build.xml are:

init
clean
compile
jar
javadoc
source
dist (default)
