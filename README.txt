I've modified the build setup to use my own universal build script. So... to build this, either copy the build scripts from the svn or master branches *or* just build the master branch directly.

Rundown of the branches:

svn - Clone of the jide-oss svn repository
develop - All of my changes and my build script
master - Most of my changes with the original jide-oss build script. I generate patches to send to JIDE from this branch.
